Python Tic Tac Toe – Classic TicTac-Toe Game in Python
REPORT:
Tic-Tac-Toe game is an easy game that is mostly played among children and it 
also helps them improve their concentration.
This tic-tac-toe game python project aims to build a tic-tac-toe game so you 
can play it without wasting paper and improve your concentration. To build 
this game we use the Tkinter module with the concept of python.
To play this game we require two players to play one is X and the other is O 
and both players play by putting their marks in empty squares.
To win the game players have to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, 
across, or diagonally).

Project Prerequisites

To build a tic-tac-toe game using python we require a Tkinter module and the 
basic concept of python
Tkinter modules is a standard graphical user interface used to render 
graphics.
Tkinter. message box used to display a message box.

Project File Structure

These are the step to build a Tic-Tac-Toe game using python:
Import modules

Initialize window

Function to check result

Function to check the winner

Define labels and buttons

Players have a total of 9 clicks to play the game. Each time the player clicked, 
one chance will decrease by increasing the value of count by 1 if the value of 
count is greater than 8 then the result of the game is a tie
If the value of count is even, then player1 will play else player2 will play.

config () used to mark the button with appropriate text

show info () methods in the message box widget used to show some 
relevant information

destroy () stop the main loop to quit the program

Label() widget used to display text that users aren’t able to modify.

Button() widget display button

root is the name of the window which we referred

text stores the value which we display on the label

font in which our text is written

command will be called when the button is clicked

lambda () function used to send specific data to the callback function.

main loop () method executes when we want to run our program.

Summary
We have successfully developed the Tic-Tac-Toe game project in python. We 
use the Tkinter module for rendering graphics on a display window. We learn 
how to create buttons and config text on buttons and also how to use lambda 
functions to send specific values to callback functions.
In this way, we successfully made a Tic-Tac-Toe game python project. I hope 
you enjoyed building the tic-tac-toe game project.
